## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Gulp.js] (https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used display: flex to setup price and time elements:

```scss
 &__price {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      flex-direction: row;
      flex-wrap: nowrap;
 }
  &__time {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      flex-direction: row;
      flex-wrap: nowrap;
  }
```


### Continued development

I'm gonna focus working on CSS Grid because I'm not 100% sure how to use it properly.

### Useful resources
